# WoWToolsDB2toCSV
WoW.Tools DB2 export 9.0.1 to CSVs for wrath DBCs. 

This code desperately needs some Abstraction as at the moment it's got quite a few hack fixes for pop up errors.

Big thanks to Alastor as he had to test these horrible exports as well help to figure out these db2 collections

Also: Fuck you Max, I do release. Wheres my Multiconvertor?

# TODO:
Turn each csv row into an object type for later updating when DB2s end up updating
