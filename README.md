# WoWToolsDB2toCSV
WoW.Tools DB2 export 9.0.1 to CSVs for wrath DBCs. 

This code desperately needs some Abstraction as at the moment it's got quite a few hack fixes for pop up errors.

Big thanks to Alastor as he had to test these horrible exports as well help to figure out these db2 collections \

If you find an error, be sure that the db2s from blizz actually do what you want, as there are some stuff like chests with leg icons, so be sure before you complain.

If there is an error, feel free to message A2#6767

Also: Fuck you Max, I do release. Wheres my Multiconvertor?

# TODO:
Turn each csv row into an object type for later updating when DB2s end up updating
